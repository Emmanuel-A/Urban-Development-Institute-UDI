            <h1>In Ontario, we don’t ask where you came from – we ask where you are going and what you need to succeed.</h1>
            <p>Did you know more than 30,000 people graduate from private career colleges (PCCs) each year? This number could be higher if the rules were fair.</p>

            <h2>The world wants a Canadian education</h2>
            <p>But right now, there are barriers to international students getting their education from a PCC in Ontario and staying in the province.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange_text">You can study here but you can’t work here</h3>
                    <p>Ontario’s employers need skilled newcomers in order for the economy to grow. Unfortunately, PCC international students are not eligible for post-graduation work permits, which are available to students at publicly funded institutions. This is a major barrier to attracting skilled people to our province and country. </p>

                    <p>Canada is facing a skills shortage. It needs more of everything. This is where PCCs can help,&nbsp;but they must be on a level playing field. PCCs must be allowed to train registered nurses, Ontario needs to include PCCs in their apprenticeship model and tuition assistance for PCCs should not be capped. </p>

                <p>Let’s change things right now. The most direct way to do this is to write to your Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) and let them know what you think. Let them know that private career colleges can and want to do more to help people achieve their dreams.</p>

They give that single mom the ability to provide for their children and new Canadians the opportunity to build their future.</p>
